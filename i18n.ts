      {
        q: "What is Neurodiversity?",
        a: "Neurodiversity is the idea that differences in the human brain (like ADHD, Autism, Dyslexia) are natural variations, not deficits. It views these conditions as valid ways of thinking and processing information."
      },
      {
        q: "Is this a formal medical diagnosis?",
        a: "No. NeuroAlign is a screening tool designed to map potential traits and functional barriers. A formal diagnosis can only be provided by a qualified healthcare professional through a clinical interview."
      },
      {
        q: "How is this different from other online tests?",
        a: "Most tests look for 'deficits' based on external behavior. NeuroAlign uses a Biopsychosocial model, prioritizing your internal lived experience, the functional cost of masking, and the specific context of your struggles."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the 'Spiky Profile'?",
        a: "Neurodivergent individuals often have 'spiky' skill profiles—excelling in some areas while struggling significantly in others. We visualize this contrast instead of averaging everything into a single 'functioning' label."
      },
      {
        q: "How is the assessment scored?",
        a: "We use a frequency-based algorithm (Never to Very Often). Responses are weighted and normalized to produce a percentage intensity for each trait. Scores above 70% suggest a strong clinical alignment."
      },
      {
        q: "What scientific methods are used?",
        a: "We integrate established protocols: ASRS v1.1 for ADHD, CAT-Q for Autism/Masking, Vinegrad for Dyslexia, ADC for Dyspraxia, and Steve Chinn's work for Dyscalculia."
      },
      {
        q: "Is my data private?",
        a: "Yes. Your data never leaves your browser. All processing happens locally on your device. We do not use tracking cookies or store personal information on any server."
      },
      {
        q: "Can I have traits from multiple conditions?",
        a: "Absolutely. Co-occurrence (comorbidity) is the rule, not the exception. It is very common to have traits of both ADHD and Autism (AuDHD), or Dyslexia and Dyspraxia."
      },
      {
        q: "Is this assessment suitable for children?",
        a: "This tool is validated for adults. While traits are lifelong, the questions focus on adult manifestations, coping mechanisms, and retrospective childhood analysis suitable for adult recall."
      },
      {
        q: "What do I do with these results?",
        a: "Use this report to advocate for yourself. You can share it with a therapist, use the strategies to adjust your daily routine, or simply use it to understand why your brain works the way it does."

        a: "La neurodiversité est l'idée que les différences neurologiques (TDAH, Autisme, etc.) sont des variations naturelles du cerveau humain, et non des déficits."
      },
      {
        q: "Est-ce un diagnostic médical formel ?",
        a: "Non. NeuroAlign est un outil de dépistage. Il identifie des probabilités et des traits. Seul un professionnel de santé qualifié peut poser un diagnostic officiel après un bilan complet."
      },
      {
        q: "En quoi est-ce différent des autres tests ?",
        a: "Contrairement aux tests basés sur l'observation, NeuroAlign utilise un modèle Bio-psycho-social. Nous privilégions votre ressenti interne, le coût du 'masquage' et l'impact fonctionnel réel."

        q: "Qu'est-ce que le 'Profil en Pics' ?",

        a: "Nous utilisons une échelle de fréquence (Jamais à Très Souvent). L'algorithme pondère les réponses pour donner un pourcentage d'intensité. Un score > 70% indique une forte probabilité clinique."
      },
      {
        q: "Quelles méthodes scientifiques sont utilisées ?",
        a: "Nous intégrons des protocoles reconnus : ASRS v1.1 (TDAH), CAT-Q (Autisme/Camouflage), Vinegrad (Dyslexie), ADC (Dyspraxie) et les travaux de Steve Chinn (Dyscalculie)."

        q: "Puis-je avoir des traits de conditions multiples ?",
