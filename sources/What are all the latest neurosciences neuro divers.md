Adult neurodivergence is not diagnosed with a single “neuroscience test” but with a battery of structured interviews, standardized questionnaires, and (sometimes) neuropsychological tests, anchored in DSM‑5‑TR and ICD‑11 criteria. Below is a concise map of the **main current tools** used for adults for autism, ADHD, learning differences and related profiles.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3]

## 1. Core diagnostic frameworks

- DSM‑5‑TR and ICD‑11 are the main classification systems used to define autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD and other neurodevelopmental conditions in adults.[^1_2][^1_3]
- Both specify that symptoms must be longstanding (childhood onset for ASD/ADHD), cause functional impact, and not be better explained by another condition.[^1_4][^1_3][^1_1]


## 2. Autism assessment in adults

### Main structured diagnostic tools

Common tools for adults (often used in combination) include:[^1_5][^1_6][^1_1][^1_4]

- Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule‑2 (ADOS‑2) – semi‑structured observation; often considered a “gold‑standard” component for ASD assessment.[^1_6][^1_5][^1_4]
- Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI‑R) – detailed developmental interview, usually with someone who knew you in childhood.[^1_1][^1_6][^1_4]
- Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) – adult‑focused package including Autism‑Spectrum Quotient and Empathy Quotient.[^1_1]
- Autism‑Spectrum Quotient (AQ) – self‑report screening of autistic traits, often used as a first filter before full evaluation.[^1_5][^1_1]
- Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale – Revised (RAADS‑R) – self‑report scale developed specifically for adults to support diagnosis.[^1_1]
- Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) – intensive, semi‑structured interview mapping autistic traits across life.[^1_1]
- Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Interview (ASDI) – structured interview for adults with possible Asperger‑type profiles.[^1_1]
- MIGDAS‑2 (Monteiro Interview Guidelines for Diagnosing the Autism Spectrum) – sensory‑based, conversational framework (in‑person or virtual) increasingly used in adult assessments.[^1_5]


### Newer / emerging directions

- DASI‑2 (Diagnostic Autism Spectrum Interview‑2) – a newer semi‑structured interview aligned with DSM‑5 and ICD‑11 criteria, designed to be freely available and adaptable; early work suggests good agreement with existing tools.[^1_7]
- Digital / AI‑assisted diagnostics – research is exploring multimodal digital measures (behavioral, cognitive, neural signals) with machine learning to support autism differential diagnosis and reduce clinician time, but these are not yet routine clinical tools.[^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_11][^1_12]
- ICF‑based, neurodiversity‑affirming approaches – work using the WHO ICF framework to map autism assessments to functioning and participation, aiming to move beyond pure “symptom” focus.[^1_13][^1_14][^1_2]


## 3. ADHD assessment in adults

Clinical diagnosis of adult ADHD is mostly interview‑ and questionnaire‑based; neuropsychological tests are optional rather than core.[^1_15][^1_16][^1_17][^1_3]

### Standard tools

- Structured clinical interview + DSM‑5 criteria check for ADHD (inattention and/or hyperactivity‑impulsivity across settings, childhood onset).[^1_3][^1_15]
- Adult ADHD Self‑Report Scale (ASRS) – widely used screening questionnaire for adults.[^1_15][^1_3]
- Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS) – self‑ and observer‑rated scales quantifying ADHD symptom frequency and impact.[^1_3][^1_15]
- Other behavior rating scales and collateral reports (partners, parents, colleagues) to document symptoms across contexts.[^1_17][^1_15][^1_3]


### Role of neuropsychological / computerized testing

- Cognitive or neuropsychological testing (e.g., attention, working memory, executive function) can clarify the profile and rule out other causes (brain injury, dementia, learning disorders), but is **not considered necessary or sufficient for diagnosis**.[^1_16][^1_17][^1_15][^1_3]
- Computerized cognitive tests (continuous performance tests, etc.) provide objective data that may complement but not replace clinical assessment.[^1_17][^1_15][^1_3]


## 4. Dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia and related profiles

For adults, assessment of learning differences and motor coordination typically uses educational/neuropsychological batteries rather than single “neurodiversity tests.”[^1_18][^1_19][^1_6]

### Typical components and tools

- Dyslexia / specific learning disorders: standardized tests of phonological processing, reading, spelling, and writing; examples include CTOPP‑2 (phonological processing), WRAT‑5 or WIAT‑III (achievement).[^1_6][^1_18]
- Dyscalculia: math‑focused tools such as the Feifer Assessment of Mathematics (FAM) to differentiate neurocognitive subtypes of math difficulty.[^1_6]
- Global cognitive profile: WAIS‑IV or similar IQ tests, memory tests (e.g., TOMAL‑2), processing‑speed measures, symbol digit modalities, etc.[^1_6]
- Developmental Coordination Disorder (dyspraxia): motor and visual‑motor integration tests such as the Beery‑VMI along with broader cognitive measures.[^1_6]


### Broad adult screening tools

- “This Is Me Too!” – an online adult screening tool (16+) giving immediate indications of likelihood for dyslexia, ADHD, autism, dyspraxia, developmental language disorder, and dyscalculia; it is a **screen**, not a formal diagnosis.[^1_19]
- University “Full Neurodiversity Diagnostic Assessment” models (e.g., FNDA) use broad psychometric testing to diagnose dyslexia and flag characteristics of ADHD/dyspraxia for further medical assessment.[^1_18]


## 5. How these tools combine in real‑world diagnosis

- Adult neurodiversity assessment is **multimodal**: clinical/developmental interview, standardized questionnaires, observation (where relevant), and, when indicated, detailed cognitive testing.[^1_4][^1_15][^1_17][^1_5][^1_6]
- Autism evaluations often center on ADOS‑2 plus a developmental interview (ADI‑R or similar), with self‑reports like AQ or RAADS‑R providing additional evidence and context.[^1_4][^1_5][^1_6][^1_1]
- ADHD is typically diagnosed through history and rating scales (ASRS, CAARS), with neuropsychological testing reserved for complex or contested cases, or when documentation for accommodations is needed.[^1_16][^1_15][^1_17][^1_3]
- Learning differences and dyspraxia rely more heavily on psychometric testing of specific skills and cognitive processes to map the person’s **profile**, which then informs accommodations and support.[^1_18][^1_6]

## Current State \& Why a Unified Tool Matters

The research shows:

- **40% of ND people meet criteria for multiple conditions**—autism + ADHD, dyslexia + dyscalculia, ADHD + dyspraxia often co-occur[^2_1][^2_2]
- **One condition masks another** if assessed separately—a slow processing speed might appear as "ADHD inattention" but actually be dyslexia[^2_1]
- **No unified adult screening tool exists** that covers all six major ND profiles in one protocol[^2_3][^2_4][^2_5]
- **Existing tools are fragmented**: autism screeners (AQ, RAADS-R), ADHD screeners (ASRS), learning difference tests separate[^2_3]
- **Neurodiversity-affirming assessment is now required best practice** (Australia mandates it; UK/US rapidly adopting)[^2_6][^2_7][^2_8]

Your tool would fill a major gap: **cost-effective, quick initial self-assessment, evidence-based, transdiagnostic, neurodiversity-affirming**.[^2_9][^2_10]

***

## Proposed Comprehensive ND Assessment Protocol for Adults

### **Core Design Principles**

1. **Transdiagnostic, modular architecture**—assess six ND profiles in one flow, with conditional branching
2. **Backed by DSM-5-TR \& ICD-11 criteria**—all questions directly map to diagnostic thresholds
3. **Screening → dimensional profiling** (not diagnosis)—gives a nuanced "trait map" even if thresholds aren't met
4. **Multimodal within constraints**—self-report + historical (childhood symptoms) + functional impact
5. **Neurodiversity-affirming**—emphasize strengths alongside challenges; language is person-first / neurodiversity-positive
6. **Fast \& accessible**—30–45 min self-directed, no jargon, mobile-friendly

***

## Protocol Structure: 6-Domain Assessment

### **PHASE 0: Intake \& Validity Check (3 min)**

**Purpose:** Ensure honest, engaged responses; flag conditions requiring specialist referral.

**Questions:**

- Current mental health baseline (depression, anxiety, substance use, head injury, seizures) — these can mimic ND traits
- Motivation for seeking assessment (self-advocacy vs. occupational/educational accommodation)
- Reading/language comprehension level (adapt complexity)
- Attention stability on the day ("are you able to focus for 40 minutes today?")

**Scoring:** Track as **context flag** (not scored), used to interpret results.

***

### **PHASE 1: AUTISM SPECTRUM PROFILE (8–10 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5-TR Criterion A (Social-Communication) \& B (Restricted/Repetitive), ICD-11 ASD[^2_11][^2_12]

**Key insight:** Autism in adults (esp. women) often presents as masking, strong interests, or sensory sensitivities—not always "social deficits" in obvious ways.

**Core sections:**

#### A. Social Communication (DSM-5-TR Criterion A)

*Items adapted from RAADS-R, AQ, MIGDAS-2*[^2_13][^2_14]

- Difficulty with social reciprocity (reading unwritten rules, maintaining eye contact, turn-taking)
- Intensity in relationships (preference for deep bonds over many shallow ones)
- Speech/communication differences (literal interpretation, difficulty with sarcasm, scripting, monotone)
- Childhood friendships: did you have close friendships or struggle to maintain them?

**Format:** 5-point Likert scale (1 = Not at all, 5 = Very much so)

#### B. Restricted/Repetitive Patterns

*Items adapted from RAADS-R, RBQ-2A*[^2_13]

- Intensity of interests: "Do you have one or two interests you know a LOT about?"
- Sensory sensitivities (sounds, textures, smells, tastes, lights)
- Need for routine/sameness ("If plans change unexpectedly, do you feel very distressed?")
- Stimming behaviors (hand movements, rocking, repetitive speech)
- Executive function: organization, planning, transitions


#### C. Childhood Symptom Onset

*Critical for ASD diagnosis—must be present before age 8 (DSM-5)*[^2_11]

- "Looking back to age 5–12, did you show any of the above traits?"
- Conditional branching: if NO childhood symptoms → ASD unlikely


#### D. Functional Impact

- "Do these traits affect your social relationships, work, or daily functioning?"
- Severity scale: 0 = none, 3 = significant (meets diagnostic threshold)

**Output:** **Autism Trait Score** (0–100) + **Dimensional Profile**

- Social-Communication subscore
- Restricted-Repetitive subscore
- Sensory subscore
- Executive-function subscore

**Interpretation guide:**

- 0–20: Low autism traits
- 21–40: Possible autism (recommend specialist assessment)
- 41–60: Moderate autism traits (likely meets ASD criteria)
- 61–100: High autism traits (strongly meets ASD criteria)

***

### **PHASE 2: ADHD PROFILE (8–10 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5-TR Criterion A1 (Inattention) \& A2 (Hyperactivity-Impulsivity), ICD-11[^2_15][^2_16]

**Key insight:** Adult ADHD is often underdiagnosed—hyperactivity may present as internal restlessness, not physical movement. Inattention masked by coping strategies.

#### A. Inattention (6 items, must have ≥5 for diagnosis)

*Adapted from ASRS, CAARS*[^2_16][^2_17]

- Difficulty sustaining attention in conversations, reading, meetings
- Careless mistakes or overlooked details
- Difficulty organizing tasks, managing time, keeping possessions
- Avoidance of tasks requiring sustained mental effort
- Easily distracted by external stimuli
- Forgetfulness in daily activities


#### B. Hyperactivity-Impulsivity (6 items, must have ≥5)

*Adapted from ASRS, CAARS*[^2_17][^2_16]

- Restlessness, fidgeting, difficulty staying seated
- Difficulty engaging in activities quietly
- Talking excessively, difficulty waiting turns
- Interrupting or intruding on others
- Difficulty inhibiting behavior
- Acting without thinking through consequences


#### C. Childhood Onset \& Duration

*Critical—ADHD must begin before age 12, persist for ≥6 months*[^2_15][^2_16]

- "Did you show these symptoms at school as a child?"
- "Have symptoms been present consistently for the past 6+ months?"
- Conditional: if NO childhood symptoms → ADHD unlikely


#### D. Cross-Situational Impact

*ADHD must impair functioning in ≥2 domains (work, home, social)*[^2_15]

- Where does inattention/impulsivity most affect you?
- Check ≥2 domains affected


#### E. Rule Out Mimics

- "Could these symptoms be better explained by stress, anxiety, depression, or medical conditions?" (flag high anxiety as possible differential)

**Output:** **ADHD Trait Score** (0–100) + **Subtype profile**

- Inattentive subscore
- Hyperactive-Impulsive subscore
- Combined type indicator

**Interpretation:**

- 0–20: Low ADHD traits
- 21–40: Possible ADHD (recommend assessment)
- 41–60: Moderate ADHD traits (likely meets criteria)
- 61–100: High ADHD traits (strongly meets criteria)

***

### **PHASE 3: DYSLEXIA \& LITERACY PROFILE (6–8 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5 Specific Learning Disorder (Dyslexia), ICD-11 Specific Learning Disorder[^2_18][^2_1]

**Key insight:** Dyslexia ≠ "bad reader"—it's a phonological processing difference. Often masked by intelligence, coping strategies, or audiobooks.

#### A. Reading \& Spelling Difficulties

*Adapted from RAADS-R, dyslexia screening items*[^2_18][^2_1]

- Slow reading speed ("Do you read slower than peers?")
- Difficulty with decoding unfamiliar words
- Spelling errors (especially phonetically irregular words)
- Difficulty with written expression
- Mixed-up letters or reversals (though less common in adults)


#### B. Phonological Processing

*Core deficit in dyslexia*[^2_1][^2_18]

- Difficulty with rhyming, word-breaking (syllables, sound segments)
- Struggle to notice/count sounds in words
- History of late speech development or speech sound difficulties


#### C. Childhood Language \& Reading History

- "Did you have speech or language delays as a child?"
- "Was learning to read difficult? Age when you became fluent?"
- "Family history of dyslexia?" (genetic loading)


#### D. Functional Impact in Adulthood

- Impact on work (emails, documents, exams)
- Compensation strategies (use of spell-check, audiobooks, re-reading)

**Output:** **Dyslexia Trait Score** (0–100) + **Profile**

- Decoding/word recognition
- Spelling
- Phonological processing
- Reading fluency
- Comprehension (typically normal in dyslexia)

**Interpretation:**

- 0–20: Low dyslexia traits
- 21–40: Possible dyslexia (recommend educational psychology assessment)
- 41–60: Moderate dyslexia traits
- 61–100: High dyslexia traits

***

### **PHASE 4: DYSCALCULIA \& NUMERACY PROFILE (4–6 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5 Specific Learning Disorder (Mathematics), ICD-11[^2_18][^2_1]

**Key insight:** Dyscalculia is NOT just "bad at math"—it's a specific deficit in number sense, calculation, or math facts. Often co-occurs with dyslexia (2 in 5 cases)[^2_1]

#### A. Number Sense \& Calculation

*Adapted from FAM, math screeners*[^2_1]

- Difficulty learning multiplication tables, basic number facts
- Struggle with mental math, counting on fingers as adult
- Difficulty understanding quantity, magnitude comparisons
- Confusion with similar-sounding numbers (17 vs. 70)
- Difficulty with money/time/measurement


#### B. Math Anxiety \& Avoidance

- Extreme anxiety when doing math
- Avoidance of math-involving tasks
- Difficulty with procedural steps (following algorithms)


#### C. Childhood Math Learning

- "Did you struggle with math from elementary school?"
- "Did it take longer to learn times tables or arithmetic?"


#### D. Functional Impact

- Impact on work (budgeting, statistics, engineering tasks)
- Compensation strategies (calculator dependence, avoidance)

**Output:** **Dyscalculia Trait Score** (0–100) + **Subdomains**

- Number sense
- Calculation fluency
- Math fact automaticity
- Procedural reasoning

**Interpretation:**

- 0–15: Low dyscalculia traits
- 16–35: Possible dyscalculia
- 36–65: Moderate dyscalculia
- 66–100: High dyscalculia

***

### **PHASE 5: DYSPRAXIA / DEVELOPMENTAL COORDINATION DISORDER (4–6 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5 Developmental Coordination Disorder, ICD-11 Developmental Coordination Disorder[^2_18][^2_1]

**Key insight:** Dyspraxia involves motor planning, coordination, and proprioception differences. Often co-occurs with ADHD (~50%) and autism[^2_2][^2_1]

#### A. Gross Motor Coordination

*Adapted from DCD screeners, Beery-VMI conceptual framework*[^2_1]

- Clumsiness, poor balance, falls frequently
- Difficulty with coordinated movements (catching, dancing, sports)
- Awkward gait or posture
- Bumps into things/knocks things over


#### B. Fine Motor Coordination

- Difficulty with handwriting (illegible, slow, tiring)
- Difficulty tying shoelaces, buttoning, using utensils
- Poor hand-eye coordination


#### C. Motor Planning \& Sequencing

- Difficulty learning new motor skills (driving, dancing, sports)
- Problems with multi-step motor tasks
- Difficulty with organization in physical space


#### D. Childhood Motor Development

- "Did you reach motor milestones later (walking, running, writing)?"
- "Were you called clumsy as a child?"


#### E. Functional Impact

- Impact on work, driving, daily activities (cooking, dressing)
- Avoidance of physical tasks

**Output:** **Dyspraxia Trait Score** (0–100) + **Motor profile**

- Gross motor
- Fine motor
- Motor planning / sequencing

**Interpretation:**

- 0–15: Low dyspraxia traits
- 16–30: Possible dyspraxia (consider physiotherapy or occupational therapy assessment)
- 31–55: Moderate dyspraxia
- 56–100: High dyspraxia

***

### **PHASE 6: DEVELOPMENTAL LANGUAGE DISORDER \& COMMUNICATION PROFILE (4–5 min)**

**Diagnostic basis:** DSM-5 Language Disorder, ICD-11 Developmental Language Disorder[^2_18][^2_1]

**Key insight:** DLD is distinct from autism (though they co-occur). Involves receptive/expressive language delays, not just pragmatic differences.

#### A. Receptive Language

- Difficulty understanding spoken language (especially in noisy environments)
- Need for repetition or slower speech
- Difficulty following multi-step instructions


#### B. Expressive Language

- Difficulty retrieving words ("tip-of-the-tongue" frequently)
- Trouble explaining complex ideas
- Grammatical errors or awkward phrasing
- Speech is slow or effortful


#### C. Childhood Language Development

- "Were you late to talk or had speech therapy?"
- "Did you have speech/language therapy in school?"


#### D. Current Functional Impact

- Impact on work (presentations, meetings, communication)
- Anxiety about speaking

**Output:** **Language Disorder Trait Score** (0–100) + **Profile**

- Receptive language
- Expressive language
- Speech clarity
- Word retrieval

**Interpretation:**

- 0–20: Low language disorder traits
- 21–40: Possible language differences
- 41–70: Moderate language disorder traits
- 71–100: High language disorder traits

***

### **PHASE 7: FUNCTIONAL IMPACT \& COEXISTING CONDITIONS (5 min)**

**Purpose:** Map how traits interact; identify when specialist assessment is urgent.

#### A. Overall Functional Impairment (WHO ICF framework)[^2_10][^2_19]

*Assess across life domains:*

- **Work/Education**: reduced productivity, difficulty meeting deadlines, social challenges
- **Self-Care**: hygiene, cooking, budgeting, organization
- **Social Relationships**: loneliness, relationship quality, communication
- **Mental Health**: anxiety, depression, burnout, trauma history
- **Quality of Life**: overall satisfaction, purpose, engagement

**Scale:** 1–5 (1 = no impact, 5 = severe impact)

#### B. Coexisting Mental Health / Neurological Conditions

*Flag for specialist referral:*

- Depression, anxiety, PTSD, complex trauma
- OCD, tics, Tourette syndrome
- Seizure disorders, concussion history
- Sleep disorders
- Chronic pain


#### C. Discrimination \& Identity

*Neurodiversity-affirming lens:*[^2_8][^2_6]

- "Do you identify as neurodivergent or neurodiverse?"
- "Have you experienced discrimination related to how your brain works?"
- "Do you have cultural, linguistic, or marginalized identities that intersect with neurodiversity?" (critical for equity)

***

## **Integrated Scoring \& Output**

### **1. Individual Trait Scores (0–100 for each domain)**

```
Autism Spectrum        : 58  [MODERATE TRAITS → Consider specialist assessment]
ADHD                   : 72  [HIGH TRAITS → Strong likelihood, specialist recommended]
Dyslexia               : 35  [POSSIBLE → Screen further with educational psych]
Dyscalculia            : 48  [MODERATE → Math-specific assessment]
Dyspraxia              : 22  [LOW-TO-POSSIBLE → Monitor coordination]
Language Disorder      : 18  [LOW → Not a primary concern]
```


### **2. Transdiagnostic Profile**

- **Coexistence pattern**: "Inattention + Autism + Dyslexia" → all three interact; suggest **integrated multi-disciplinary assessment**
- **Masking/compensation**: "High autism + low diagnosed social impact" → likely significant masking; recommend trauma-informed assessment
- **Sensory/motor profile**: Map sensory sensitivities (autism + dyspraxia) → occupational therapy may help


### **3. Neurodiversity-Affirming Summary**

*Example output for someone scoring high across autism + ADHD + dyslexia:*

> **Your Neurodiversity Profile**
>
> You show significant traits associated with autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. Rather than viewing these separately as "deficits," they work together to shape how you think, move, and process the world:
>
> - **Your autism traits** suggest strong pattern recognition, detail-focus, and deep interests—paired with differences in social communication and sensory sensitivities
> - **Your ADHD traits** may reflect quick idea generation, creative problem-solving, and adaptability—alongside challenges with sustained focus and transitions
> - **Your dyslexia traits** suggest strengths in visual-spatial thinking and 3D reasoning, alongside differences in decoding written language
>
> **Strengths to build on:** creativity, persistence, unique perspective-taking, ability to hyperfocus, resilience
>
> **Areas that may need support:** written communication tools, sensory accommodation, movement breaks, external structures
>
> **Next steps:** Specialist assessment recommended (clinical psychologist + developmental/educational context); occupational therapy for sensory/motor strategies.

### **4. Clinical Urgency Flags**

*Auto-route to specialist if:*

- **High autism + high ADHD** (40% co-occurrence; complex assessment needed)[^2_2][^2_1]
- **Multiple domains scored >50** (comprehensive multi-disciplinary assessment)
- **Childhood onset NOT confirmed** in any domain (reconsider acquired/secondary causes)
- **Severe functional impairment** (work loss, self-harm ideation, isolation)
- **Undiagnosed mental health crisis** (depression, suicidality, trauma)

***

## **Evidence-Based Instrument Selection**

To ensure **medical validity**, build the protocol from **validated, published, freely-available or openly-licensed instruments:**


| Domain | Primary Instrument | Secondary | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Autism** | RAADS-R (adult-specific, freely available) + selective items from AQ | MIGDAS-2 conversational framework | RAADS-R designed for adults; AQ brief screening |
| **ADHD** | ASRS v1.1 (WHO, free, 6 items) + CAARS self-report structure | Conners (if available) | ASRS is gold-standard quick screener; free |
| **Dyslexia** | Dyslexia screener items (British Dyslexia Assoc.) + phonological processing | Questionnaire items re: childhood reading | Publicly available; no cost; evidence-based |
| **Dyscalculia** | FAM (Feifer Assessment of Mathematics) conceptual structure; adapted for screening | Math anxiety + number sense items | FAM is gold-standard; can design free screening parallel |
| **Dyspraxia** | DCD-Q (Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire, modified) | Beery-VMI conceptual items on visual-motor | DCD-Q validated; motor items can be behavioral report |
| **Language Disorder** | SLI screener items (Semel et al.) + word retrieval / comprehension items | Clinical Interview for Language Disorders | Mix of published \& custom items based on DSM-5 |
| **Functional Impact** | WHO ICF brief version (free) + SDQ (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, free) | Adapted from functioning measures in NAS co-design | Open-access; neurodiversity-affirming framing |


***

## **Technical \& Design Recommendations**

### **Software Architecture**

1. **Frontend**: React / Vue.js single-page app (mobile-responsive)
2. **Backend**: Node.js + PostgreSQL (GDPR-compliant, end-to-end encryption for data)
3. **Algorithm**:
    - Branching logic (skip sections if childhood onset denied)
    - Real-time scoring
    - Conditional flagging for urgency
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA (dyslexia-friendly fonts, dyslexic-specific color palette, adjustable text size)

### **User Experience**

- **Progress bar** (shows which section)
- **Explanatory tooltips** ("What do we mean by stimming?")
- **Simplified language** (plain English, avoid jargon)
- **Reassurance messaging** ("This tool doesn't diagnose—it screens")
- **Export-to-PDF** for sharing with clinicians
- **Optional: voice-to-text input** (for dyslexia-friendly data entry)


### **Data \& Privacy**

- **No account required** (unless user wants to save/revisit)
- **Anonymous mode** option
- **GDPR / HIPAA compliant**
- **Option to securely share results with healthcare provider** (encrypted link)


### **Validation Plan**

1. **Pilot with 200–300 ND adults** (compare to clinical diagnoses)
2. **Sensitivity/specificity analysis** for each domain
3. **Qualitative feedback** from neurodivergent users (lived experience advisory board)
4. **Cross-validation against ADOS-2, ADI-R, clinical interviews** (subset)

***

## **Medical/Ethical Framework**

### **Informed Consent \& Disclaimers**

- **This is a screening tool, NOT a diagnosis**
- "Only a qualified healthcare professional (psychologist, psychiatrist, neuropsychologist) can diagnose neurodevelopmental conditions"
- Link to **reputable diagnostic pathways** (NHS, university disability services, private practices)
- **Crisis resources** if suicidality/self-harm flagged


### **Neurodiversity-Affirming Principles**[^2_7][^2_6][^2_8]

1. **Strengths-based language**: Emphasize adaptive advantages, not just difficulties
2. **Avoid medicalization**: Frame as "neurological difference," not "disorder"
3. **Intersectionality**: Acknowledge how gender, race, class, sexuality intersect with ND diagnosis/masking
4. **Community involvement**: Co-design with neurodivergent adults; avoid ableist assumptions
5. **Post-assessment support**: Offer resources (self-advocacy, accommodations, community, therapists specializing in ND)

***

## **Integration with Existing Pathways**

**Your tool bridges:**

1. **Self-identification** → **Screening** → **Clinical assessment** → **Diagnosis \& support**
2. **Faster access** for those waiting for NHS/university services
3. **Informed discussions** with clinicians (users arrive with trait map, not just "I think I'm autistic")
4. **Reduced diagnostic bias** (catches masking, intersectional cases)

***

## **Rollout Strategy (Phased)**

### **Phase 1: MVP (3–6 months)**

- Autism + ADHD + Dyslexia core (3 domains)
- Basic scoring, PDF export
- Landing page with disclaimers
- Beta test with 50 ND volunteers


### **Phase 2: Expansion (6–12 months)**

- Add Dyscalculia, Dyspraxia, Language Disorder
- Transdiagnostic insights
- Specialist referral directory (Belgium-focused + EU)
- Mobile app (iOS/Android)


### **Phase 3: Clinical Integration (Year 2)**

- Integration with clinical portals (hospitals, university disability services)
- Longitudinal tracking (user can re-assess annually)
- Anonymized research database (with consent)
- Training materials for clinicians on using tool results

***

## **Why This Matters for You \& Your Users**

✅ **Speed**: 30–45 min vs. months of specialist waiting lists
✅ **Affordability**: Free or low-cost vs. €500–2000 private assessment
✅ **Equity**: Catches women, people of color, working-class ND people often missed by traditional pathways
✅ **Empowerment**: Users understand their own neurodiversity before clinician appointment
✅ **Evidence-based**: Every question grounded in DSM-5-TR/ICD-11 + peer-reviewed instruments
✅ **Community impact**: Could reshape how Belgium (and EU) approaches adult ND diagnosis

    Your traits may be underestimated; fatigue/burnout risk high.
    Recommendation: Prioritize rest, authenticity, and support.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:

  Work/Occupational:    3.8/5  (Significant impact on productivity, 
                                focus, organization)
  Self-Care:            3.2/5  (Moderate difficulty with hygiene, 
                                organization, routines)
  Relationships:        4.1/5  (High impact; social exhaustion, 
                                communication challenges)
  Quality of Life:      2.5/5  (Below baseline; may indicate burnout 
                                or unmet support needs)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

MENTAL HEALTH FLAGS:

  ⚠ Depression Screening:      3.2/5  (Moderate; recommend evaluation)
  ⚠ Anxiety Screening:         4.3/5  (High; anxiety assessment + 
                                        therapy may help)
  ⚠ Sleep Difficulty:          3.9/5  (Significant; sleep specialist 
                                        consultation beneficial)
  ✓ Trauma/PTSD:              2.1/5  (Low current indication, but 
                                       autism/ADHD + anxiety history 
                                       warrants trauma-informed care)
  ✓ Suicidality:              1.0/5  (No current risk indicated)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERPRETATION (Neurodiversity-Affirming):

You show significant traits associated with BOTH autism spectrum and ADHD.
Rather than viewing these as separate "deficits," they work together to 
shape your unique neurodevelopmental profile:

🧠 AUTISM TRAITS (67/100):
   • Strong pattern recognition and attention to detail
   • Deep, focused interests and expertise
   • Sensory sensitivities requiring accommodation
   • Social communication differences (not deficits!)
   • Need for structure and clarity
   
   STRENGTHS: Creative problem-solving, loyalty, pattern detection, 
              unique perspective-taking
   
   CHALLENGES: Social masking fatigue, sensory overwhelm, transitions 
               may need support structures

⚡ ADHD TRAITS (78/100):
   • Rapid idea generation and creative thinking
   • Ability to hyperfocus on engaging tasks
   • High adaptability and responsiveness
   • Quick action-taking and spontaneity
   • Thrives with novelty and stimulation
   
   STRENGTHS: Creativity, quick thinking, adaptability, enthusiasm, 
              resilience
   
   CHALLENGES: Sustained attention, task initiation, time management, 
               impulse regulation may need external structure

🎯 DYSPRAXIA TRAITS (48/100 - Moderate):
   • May influence fine motor (writing) and gross motor (coordination) 
     tasks
   • Sensory-motor integration differences
   
   STRENGTHS: Often strong visual-spatial reasoning, 3D thinking
   
   CHALLENGES: Handwriting speed/legibility, coordination, motor planning 
               may benefit from OT strategies

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

INTERSECTIONAL CONTEXT:

You report experiencing discrimination related to neurodiversity. This is 
unfortunately common and reflects systemic barriers, not personal failure. 
Your neurodivergence is valid and valuable. The challenges you face are 
partly structural (ableism, lack of accommodation) rather than individual.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NEXT STEPS:

1. SPECIALIST ASSESSMENT (Recommended Priority: HIGH)
   → Clinical psychologist or neuropsychologist specializing in adult 
     neurodevelopment
   → Formal autism + ADHD assessment using ADOS-2, RAADS-14, ASRS, 
     clinical interview
   → Estimated timeline: 2–6 months depending on wait list

2. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT (Immediate)
   → Therapist specializing in anxiety + neurodiversity (trauma-informed, 
     affirming)
   → Consider: CBT, DBT, or somatic therapies for anxiety management
   → Sleep specialist consultation (sleep difficulty noted)

3. PRACTICAL ACCOMMODATIONS (Now)
   → Work: Request: flexible hours, quiet workspace, asynchronous 
           communication, written instructions
   → Study: Audiobooks, extended time, movement breaks, reduced 
           distractions
   → Personal: External organization tools (calendar, reminders, lists), 
              sensory regulation (stim toys, noise-canceling headphones)

4. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (Consider)
   → Sensory diet and regulation strategies
   → Fine/gross motor support if dyspraxia impacts daily life

5. COMMUNITY & ADVOCACY
   → Connect with neurodivergent communities (local or online) for peer 
     support
   → Self-advocacy education (how to request accommodations, disclose 
     diagnosis when needed)
   → Consider identity integration: "I'm neurodivergent" as neutral/positive 
     identity

## **VARIATION TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED**

To reduce **response bias** and maintain engagement, I've used:

### **Negation/Reverse Scoring** (40% of items)

- **Positive-phrased items**: "I struggle with X"
- **Negative-phrased items**: "I don't have difficulty with X"
- Alternates prevent "yes-saying" or "acquiescence bias"
- Example: Q1.1 (positive) vs Q1.2 (negative reverse)


### **Temporal Variation**

- **Current-focused**: "I currently experience..."
- **Developmental history**: "As a child, I..."
- **Lifelong pattern**: "Throughout my life..."
- Distinguishes acquired vs. developmental traits


### **Domain Specificity**

- **General functioning**: "I struggle with X in general"
- **Specific contexts**: "At work, I struggle with X"
- **Threshold language**: "Significantly more than..." vs. "Somewhat..."
- Captures context-dependent expression


### **Strength-Focused Reframing** (Selected items)

- Q1.17: "I can hyperfocus" (strength framing of focus intensity)
- Q2.18: "Seek stimulation" (adaptive aspect of ADHD trait)
- Supports neurodiversity-affirming lens


### **Symptom-Specific Wording**

- **Autism social**: Ranges from "hidden rules" → "eye contact" → "turn-taking" → "bluntness"
- **ADHD attention**: "Sustaining attention" → "careless errors" → "listening" → "organization"
- Each captures different manifestation of construct
