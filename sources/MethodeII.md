The Unified Adult Neurodiversity Assessment Framework: A Comprehensive Methodology for Transdiagnostic Symptom Profiling and Auto-Scoring1. Executive Summary and Theoretical Framework1.1 The Paradigm Shift in Adult NeurodiagnosticsThe clinical approach to neurodevelopmental conditions has traditionally operated within a pathological model, categorizing individuals into discrete diagnostic silos such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dyslexia, Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD/Dyspraxia), and Dyscalculia. This compartmentalization, while useful for specific therapeutic interventions in childhood, often fails to capture the complex, overlapping reality of adult neurodivergence. Contemporary research underscores a significant phenotypic overlap, with comorbidity rates between these conditions estimated as high as 50-70%. For the adult population—often termed the "lost generation" due to historical under-diagnosis—traditional criteria can be exclusionary. These individuals frequently present with a "spiky profile" of cognitive strengths and challenges, masked by decades of learned compensatory strategies.This methodology file establishes a rigorous framework for a Unified Neurodiversity Auto-Test. Unlike binary diagnostic tools, this instrument utilizes a multi-dimensional scoring engine derived from validated clinical screeners—specifically the ASRS v1.1, CAT-Q, Vinegrad Checklist, ADC, and Chinn Dyscalculia Checklist. The methodology is designed to move beyond the "disorder" paradigm and towards a Biopsychosocial and Symptom-Based Approach, prioritizing the user's lived experience and functional cost over external behavioral observation.1.2 The Neurocognitive Basis of Symptom-Based InquiryStandard diagnostic interviews often utilize condition-based questioning (e.g., "Do you have difficulty maintaining eye contact?"). For an undiagnosed adult, the answer is frequently a false negative because they have intellectually mastered the rule of maintaining eye contact, despite the immense cognitive load required to do so. This phenomenon, known as "camouflaging" or "masking," is particularly prevalent in females and late-diagnosed individuals.To address this, the proposed methodology rephrases all psychometric items into phenomenological inquiries. These questions probe the internal effort, anxiety, and exhaustion associated with specific tasks rather than the task performance itself. For instance, rather than asking if a user can organize a workspace (which they might achieve through obsessive rigidity), the system asks about the anxiety triggered by disorganization or the time required to achieve order. This shift from "can you?" to "what does it cost you?" is the cornerstone of high-fidelity adult screening.1.3 The "Spiky Profile" and Heatmap ScoringThe output of this auto-test is not a singular "neurodiversity score," which would flatten the nuance of the individual's cognition. Instead, the scoring logic generates a "Neurodivergent Heatmap" or "Spiky Profile." This visualization maps the user's responses against normalized severity indices for Executive Function (ADHD), Social Camouflaging (Autism), Phonological Processing (Dyslexia), Motor Integration (Dyspraxia), and Number Sense (Dyscalculia).This approach allows for the identification of specific neurocognitive signatures, such as the "AuDHD" profile (co-occurring Autism and ADHD), where high structure-seeking traits may actively mask impulsivity, leading to a unique presentation of burnout rather than externalizing behaviors.2. Module I: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)2.1 Theoretical Underpinnings and Instrument SelectionThe Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS v1.1) serves as the core instrument for this module. Developed in conjunction with the World Health Organization, the ASRS is calibrated to the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 criteria but specifically adapted for the adult phenotype. Adult ADHD is rarely defined by the overt hyperactivity seen in children; instead, it manifests as deficits in Executive Function—specifically in working memory, emotional regulation, and internal restlessness.The ASRS is structurally divided into Part A (The Screener) and Part B (Symptom Checklist). Part A consists of six questions identified through regression analysis as the most predictive of a clinical diagnosis. A critical feature of the ASRS is its sensitivity to the frequency of symptoms. While neurotypical adults may occasionally lose keys or forget appointments, the ASRS sets specific frequency thresholds (e.g., "Often" or "Very Often") that distinguish pathology from normal variance.2.2 Item Construction and Clinical RationaleThe following items have been adapted for the user interface. They retain the semantic core of the validated ASRS items but are prefaced to encourage reflection on the internal experience over the last six months.Scoring Scale: Never (0) | Rarely (1) | Sometimes (2) | Often (3) | Very Often (4)Part A: The Predictive Core (Executive Function & Drive)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical Construct & RationaleThreshold for "Hit"ADHD_01"Once you have managed to complete the challenging, stimulating parts of a project, how often do you find yourself physically or mentally unable to wrap up the final, boring details?"Executive Closure: Measures the dopamine-drop associated with task completion. Adults with ADHD struggle to sustain effort once the novelty or urgency fades.Sometimes +ADHD_02"When a task requires you to organize your thoughts or materials in a specific sequence, how often do you feel overwhelmed or unable to get things in order?"Sequencing/Organization: Assesses deficits in the "mind's blackboard" (working memory) required to hold and manipulate multiple steps.Sometimes +ADHD_03"How often do you find yourself forgetting appointments or obligations, even those that are important to you or that you genuinely wanted to attend?"Prospective Memory: Indicates a failure of the "time horizon." The low threshold ("Sometimes") reflects the high functional impairment of this symptom in adult life.Sometimes +ADHD_04"When facing a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you find yourself avoiding or delaying getting started (task paralysis)?"Initiation/Procrastination: Probes the "wall of awful" or initiation deficit, linked to insufficient dopamine for task engagement.Often +ADHD_05"How often do you find yourself fidgeting, tapping your hands/feet, or squirming when you are required to sit still for a long time?"Motor Agitation: Captures the "micro-movements" that replace childhood running/climbing in adults.Often +ADHD_06"How often do you feel an internal sense of being overly active, or compelled to do things as if you were 'driven by a motor'?"Internal Restlessness: The defining metaphor for adult hyperactive/impulsive presentation. It reflects a chronic, unquiet internal state.Often +Part B: The Impairment Checklist (Regulation & Processing)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical Construct & RationaleThreshold for "Hit"ADHD_07"How often do you make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring or difficult project?"Attention to Detail: Indicates deficits in self-monitoring and sustained attention on low-dopamine tasks.Often +ADHD_08"How often do you have difficulty keeping your attention focused when you are doing boring or repetitive work?"Sustained Attention: Measures the capacity to regulate alertness in the absence of external stimulation.Often +ADHD_09"How often do you find it difficult to concentrate on what people are saying to you, even when they are speaking to you directly?"Auditory Processing: Assesses the "zoning out" phenomenon where auditory input is not processed into meaning.Often +ADHD_10"How often do you misplace or have difficulty finding things at home or at work (e.g., keys, phone, wallet)?"Object Permanence: Reflects deficits in organizational working memory and tracking.Often +ADHD_11"How often are you distracted by activity or noise around you?"Sensory Gating: Indicates a failure to filter out irrelevant environmental stimuli (leaky attention filter).Often +ADHD_12"How often do you leave your seat in meetings or other situations in which you are expected to remain seated?"Inhibition Control: Situational hyperactivity and difficulty suppressing the urge to move.Often +ADHD_13"How often do you feel restless or fidgety?"General Restlessness: A broader measure of the physiological need for stimulation.Often +ADHD_14"How often do you have difficulty unwinding and relaxing when you have time to yourself?"Arousal Regulation: The "busy brain" phenomenon; inability to down-regulate the nervous system.Often +ADHD_15"How often do you find yourself talking too much when you are in social situations?"Verbal Hyperactivity: Externalizing thoughts without a filter; a form of impulsivity.Often +ADHD_16"When in a conversation, how often do you find yourself finishing other people's sentences before they can?"Impulsivity/Speed: Reflects impatience and a faster cognitive processing speed than the conversational partner.Often +ADHD_17"How often do you have difficulty waiting your turn in situations when turn taking is required?"Delay Aversion: Difficulty tolerating the gap between impulse and action.Often +ADHD_18"How often do you interrupt others when they are busy?"Social Impulsivity: Failure to inhibit social intrusion despite knowing social rules.Often +2.3 Precision Scoring and InterpretationThe algorithm must calculate three distinct metrics to provide a nuanced profile:The Part A Screener Score:Calculation: Count the number of items in Part A (1-6) that meet the "Threshold for Hit."Interpretation: A score of 4 or higher indicates a clinical probability of ADHD. This metric has the highest sensitivity for detecting the condition.The Symptom Density Score (SDS):Calculation: Sum the numerical values (0-4) of all 18 items. Range: 0–72.Interpretation: This provides a continuous variable of severity.0-20: No clinically significant symptoms.21-35: Mild/Sub-clinical traits (Executive dysfunction may be present but not pervasive).36+: Moderate to Severe ADHD presentation.Subtype Classification:Inattentive Cluster: Sum of Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.Hyperactive/Impulsive Cluster: Sum of Items 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.Result: Compare the two cluster scores. A discrepancy of >20% defines the subtype (Inattentive vs. Hyperactive). Balanced scores indicate Combined Type, which is the most common presentation in adults who have internalized their hyperactivity.3. Module II: Autism Spectrum (Masking Focus)3.1 Theoretical Underpinnings: The Camouflaging ParadigmTraditional autism screening tools, such as the AQ-10 or AQ-50, rely heavily on observable behaviors (e.g., "I prefer to do things alone"). While valid, these tools often yield false negatives for the "lost generation" of adults—particularly women and gender-diverse individuals—who have developed sophisticated compensatory mechanisms. This phenomenon, known as Camouflaging, involves the conscious or unconscious suppression of autistic traits to "pass" as neurotypical.Therefore, this methodology utilizes the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) as the primary screening engine. The CAT-Q does not measure autism directly; it measures the strategy and effort of social coping. High scores on the CAT-Q are strongly correlated with an autism diagnosis, even in individuals who score below the threshold on standard trait measures. This aligns with the "Double Empathy Problem" theory, suggesting that social difficulties are bidirectional and often managed by the autistic person through intense intellectual labor.3.2 Item Construction and Clinical RationaleThe CAT-Q consists of 25 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree to 7=Strongly Agree). The items serve as a window into the cognitive labor of social interaction.Sub-Scales:Compensation: Developing explicit strategies (scripts, rules) to overcome social deficits.Masking: Hiding autistic traits (stimming, facial expressions) to avoid detection.Assimilation: Strategies to fit in with the group to avoid social exclusion.(Items marked with (R) are reverse-scored: 1=7, 7=1)Factor 1: Compensation (Intellectualizing Socialization)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical Construct & RationaleCAT_01"When interacting with someone, do you deliberately copy their body language or facial expressions to build rapport?"Mirroring: Using mimicry as a manual bridge for empathy.CAT_04"Have you developed a 'script' or set of prepared phrases to follow in social situations?"Scripting: Reliance on pre-computed algorithms for conversation rather than intuition.CAT_05"Do you repeat phrases or distinct wording exactly as you first heard them from others?"Echolalia/Mimicry: Using borrowed language to navigate social exchange.CAT_08"In social interactions, do you use specific behaviors that you have learned by watching others interact?"Social Learning: Treating social behavior as an academic subject to be studied.CAT_11"Do you practice your facial expressions and body language in private to ensure they look natural?"Rehearsal: The "actor's preparation" for daily life.CAT_14"Have you explicitly researched the rules of social interactions to improve your social skills?"Systemizing Sociality: Using rule-based logic to navigate fluid social dynamics.CAT_17"Do you learn how to speak or behave from TV, films, or books and apply these to your own interactions?"Media Modeling: Using fictional templates for real-world interaction.CAT_20"Do you think about the impression you make on others more than they likely think about the impression they make on you?"Hyper-Mentalizing: Excessive, anxious calculation of others' perceptions.CAT_23"Do you engage in 'social scripting' by pre-planning conversations in your head before they happen?"Forecasting: Reducing uncertainty through simulation.Factor 2: Masking (The Cost of Concealment)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical Construct & RationaleCAT_02"Do you constantly monitor your body language or facial expressions to ensure you appear relaxed?"Affect Management: The paradox of "working hard to look relaxed."CAT_06"Do you adjust your body language or face to appear interested, even if you are not?"Performative Engagement: Manual operation of social signals.CAT_09"Do you feel like you are 'acting' or playing a role rather than being yourself in social situations?"Dissociation: The separation of the authentic self from the social persona.CAT_12 (R)"Do you rarely feel the need to put on an act to get through a social situation?"Authenticity Ease: Reverse scored. Agreement indicates lower masking.CAT_15"Do you consciously monitor your face and body to ensure you look interested in the person you are interacting with?"Vigilance: Continuous self-auditing of non-verbal output.CAT_18 (R)"Do you feel free to be your authentic self in social situations?"Social Safety: Reverse scored. Agreement indicates lower masking.CAT_21"Are you always acutely aware of the impression you are making on others?"Self-Consciousness: Chronic high self-monitoring.CAT_24"Do you have to force yourself to make eye contact with others?"Gaze Suppression: Overriding the natural instinct to avert gaze to reduce sensory input.Factor 3: Assimilation (The Drive to Blend In)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical Construct & RationaleCAT_03 (R)"Do you rarely feel the need to put on an act in order to get through a social situation?"Performance Necessity: Reverse scored. (Distinct nuance from CAT_12 in factor analysis).CAT_07"In social situations, do you feel like you are 'performing' rather than being yourself?"Performance Fatigue: The exhaustion derived from sustained acting.CAT_10"Do you have to force yourself to interact with people when you are in social situations?"Social Inertia: Overcoming the natural preference for solitude/parallel play.CAT_13"Do you spend a lot of time thinking about what you are going to say before you say it?"Latency Compensation: Covering up processing delays.CAT_16"Do you avoid interacting with people unless you absolutely have to?"Avoidance: A primary strategy to manage energy resources.CAT_19"Do you find it difficult to interact with people you don't know well?"Novelty Anxiety: Difficulty predicting behaviors of unknown agents.CAT_22"Is appearing 'normal' or 'socially competent' very important to you?"Normativity Bias: Internalized pressure to conform to neurotypical standards.CAT_25"Do you generally avoid social situations where you might have to interact with others?"Social Withdrawal: Preservation of cognitive resources.3.3 Precision Scoring and InterpretationThe scoring algorithm must account for the high variance in camouflaging behaviors across genders. Research indicates that autistic females score significantly higher on the CAT-Q than autistic males, often surpassing the thresholds used for general screening.Total Score Calculation: Sum of all 25 items (accounting for reverse scoring of 3, 12, 18).Range: 25 - 175.Clinical Thresholds:Score > 100: Indicates a High Probability of Camouflaged Autism. This threshold is robust; neurotypical controls typically score below 75, while the mean for autistic women is ~124 and autistic men ~110.The "Masking Gap" Flag:The system should compare the CAT-Q score with the ASRS (ADHD) and other module scores.Logic: If CAT-Q > 120 (Extreme Masking), the system must append a disclaimer to all other results: "Your extremely high masking score suggests that you have developed powerful coping mechanisms. These strategies may suppress your scores on other symptom checklists (like ADHD or Dyslexia), effectively hiding your struggles. A lower score in other areas should be interpreted with caution."4. Module III: Dyslexia (Adult Processing & Literacy)4.1 Theoretical Underpinnings: Beyond ReadingDyslexia in adults is not merely a reading difficulty; it is a fundamental difference in information processing, often characterized by deficits in the phonological loop, working memory, and visual-spatial sequencing. Many adults have "remediated" their reading issues but continue to struggle with organization, directionality, and rapid naming. The Vinegrad Adult Dyslexia Checklist is the industry standard for this demographic because it queries these persistent "soft signs" rather than literacy alone.4.2 Item Construction and Statistical WeightingThe Vinegrad checklist comprises 20 Yes/No items. However, statistical analysis has identified a subset of "Best 12" items that possess the highest discriminant validity. This methodology utilizes a weighted scoring system where the "Best 12" carry greater diagnostic significance.Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructWeightingDYS_01"Do you have persistent difficulty in telling left from right instantly?"Laterality/Directionality: A classic cerebellar/magnocellular sign.High (Best 12)DYS_02"Is map reading or finding your way to a strange place confusing?"Visuospatial Processing: Difficulty rotating mental maps.StandardDYS_03"Do you dislike reading aloud?"Phonological Retrieval: Anxiety around rapid decoding.StandardDYS_04"Do you take longer than you should to read a page of a book?"Processing Speed: Slow decoding even with accuracy.High (Best 12)DYS_05"Do you find it difficult to remember the sense (meaning) of what you have just read?"Working Memory: Decoding effort consumes cognitive load needed for comprehension.StandardDYS_06"Do you dislike reading long books?"Sustained Effort: Visual fatigue/stress.StandardDYS_07"Is your spelling poor, or do you rely heavily on spell-checkers?"Orthographic Coding: Inability to visualize word forms.High (Best 12)DYS_08"Is your handwriting difficult to read?"Graphomotor: Dysgraphia overlap.StandardDYS_09"Do you get confused if you have to speak in public?"Verbal Sequencing: Organizing thoughts under pressure.StandardDYS_10"Do you find it difficult to take messages on the telephone and pass them on correctly?"Auditory Working Memory: Holding sequences of numbers/names.High (Best 12)DYS_11"When you have to say a long word, do you sometimes find it difficult to get all the sounds in the right order?"Phonological Sequencing: Polysyllabic integration.High (Best 12)DYS_12"Do you find it difficult to do sums in your head without using your fingers or paper?"Working Memory Load: Dyscalculia overlap.StandardDYS_13"When using the telephone, do you tend to get the numbers mixed up when you dial?"Visual-Sequential Memory: Transposing digits.High (Best 12)DYS_14"Do you find it difficult to say the months of the year forwards in a fluent manner?"Automatized Sequencing: Rapid naming deficit.High (Best 12)DYS_15"Do you find it difficult to say the months of the year backwards?"Reverse Sequencing: High executive load task.StandardDYS_16"Do you mix up dates and times and miss appointments?"Temporal Organization: Time blindness/Sequencing.High (Best 12)DYS_17"When writing cheques or filling forms, do you frequently find yourself making mistakes?"Clerical Accuracy: Visual-motor integration.High (Best 12)DYS_18"Do you find forms difficult and confusing?"Visual Crowding: Information overload.High (Best 12)DYS_19"Do you mix up bus numbers like 95 and 59?"Symbol Reversal: Directional confusion.High (Best 12)DYS_20"Did you find it hard to learn your multiplication tables at school?"Rote Memory: Long-term retrieval deficit.High (Best 12)4.3 Precision Scoring and InterpretationTotal Score: Sum of "Yes" responses.Threshold Analysis:0-4: Low probability.5-8: Moderate probability (At Risk).9+: High Probability of Dyslexia. (Research shows 90% of adults with 9+ items have dyslexia ).Discriminant Check: If the Total Score is in the "Moderate" range (5-8), the algorithm calculates the count of "Best 12" items.Rule: If ≥ 6 of the "Best 12" are positive, the status is upgraded to Probable Dyslexia. This accounts for individuals who have compensated for general reading tasks but fail on the distinct cognitive markers of the condition.5. Module IV: Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD/Dyspraxia)5.1 Theoretical Underpinnings: The Developmental RequirementDCD, often called Dyspraxia, involves deficits in motor planning (praxis) and execution. A critical diagnostic criterion (DSM-5 Criterion B) is that the deficit must manifest in the early developmental period. Therefore, an adult auto-test must assess both current functioning and childhood history. The Adult DCD Checklist (ADC) by Kirby et al. is the only instrument validated to capture this temporal continuity.5.2 Item Construction: The Two-Stage AssessmentThe ADC uses a frequency scale: Never (0), Sometimes (1), Frequently (2), Always (3). The test includes 40 items total, split between childhood retrospective and current adult symptoms.Section A: Childhood History (Developmental Validity)Context: "Thinking back to your childhood, how often did you experience the following?"Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructDCD_C01"Did you have difficulties with self-care tasks such as tying shoelaces, fastening buttons, or zips?"Fine Motor (Self-care): Classic sign of fine motor delay.DCD_C02"Did you have difficulty eating without getting dirty or spilling things?"Oral/Motor Control: Feeding coordination.DCD_C03"Did you struggle to learn to ride a bike compared to your peers?"Gross Motor/Balance: Vestibular/Proprioceptive integration.DCD_C04"Did you have difficulties playing team games (e.g., catching a ball, football)?"Ballistic Skills: Hand-eye coordination and timing.DCD_C05"Was your handwriting untidy, illegible, or painful to produce?"Graphomotor: Dysgraphia overlap.DCD_C06"Were you considered clumsy, or did you bump into objects/people often?"Proprioception: Body schema awareness.DCD_C07"Did you actively avoid sports or physical activities?"Avoidance: Secondary behavioral response to deficit.DCD_C08"Did you have trouble using scissors or other tools?"Bilateral Integration: Using two hands together.DCD_C09"Did you take longer to learn new motor skills than others?"Motor Learning: Procedural memory deficit.DCD_C10"Did you feel different from your peers due to coordination issues?"Psychosocial Impact: Emotional consequence of DCD.Section B: Current Adult Functioning (Functional Impairment)Context: "In your current daily life, how often do you experience the following?"Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructDCD_A01"Do you tend to drop objects (e.g., keys, phone, dishes) more often than others?"Grip Control: Force modulation failure.DCD_A02"Do you often bump into door frames, furniture, or other people?"Spatial Awareness: Poor body mapping.DCD_A03"Do you find it difficult to organize your workspace or pack a suitcase efficiently?"Spatial Organization: Visuospatial executive function.DCD_A04"Do you avoid driving, or find parking and judging distances difficult?"Visuospatial Integration: Calculating velocity/distance.DCD_A05"Is your handwriting still difficult to read or painful to produce for long periods?"Persistent Graphomotor Deficit.DCD_A06"Do you find tasks requiring precision (e.g., shaving, makeup, DIY) difficult?"Fine Motor Precision.DCD_A07"Do you spill drinks or food when eating?"Kinematic Control.DCD_A08"Do you feel you lack energy or fatigue easily due to the effort of physical tasks?"Motor Fatigue: The high energy cost of conscious motor control.DCD_A09"Do you have trouble planning the sequence of steps needed to complete a practical task (e.g., cooking)?"Ideational Praxis: The "planning" component of Dyspraxia.DCD_A10"Do you choose hobbies or jobs that require little physical coordination?"Lifestyle Adaptation/Avoidance.5.3 Precision Scoring and InterpretationChildhood Score (Section A): Sum of items.Criterion: A score of 17 or higher establishes the necessary developmental history for a DCD diagnosis.Total ADC Score (Sections A+B): Sum of all items.Range: 0 - 120 (approximate based on item count scaling).Interpretation:< 80: Unlikely DCD.80 - 89: Borderline / At Risk.> 90: Probable DCD/Dyspraxia.Differential Diagnosis Flag:If Adult Score is High but Childhood Score is < 17, the system must flag: "Results indicate significant current motor difficulties, but the lack of childhood history suggests this may be an acquired issue or related to another condition (e.g., sensory processing) rather than Developmental Coordination Disorder. Clinical consultation is recommended to rule out neurological causes."6. Module V: Dyscalculia (Number Sense & Anxiety)6.1 Theoretical Underpinnings: The Approximate Number SystemDyscalculia is often trivialized as "being bad at math," but it stems from a core deficit in the Approximate Number System (ANS)—the innate cognitive machinery used to estimate quantities without counting. This leads to difficulties with subitizing (instantly seeing that there are four dots on a dice) and estimating magnitude. Additionally, Maths Anxiety creates a specific working memory block that mimics dyscalculia. The Steve Chinn Checklist is selected for its ability to qualitatively distinguish between these factors.6.2 Item Construction: Domains of NumeracyThe checklist uses a 5-point frequency scale (1=Never to 5=Always). We focus on 15 high-impact items across three domains.Domain A: Core Number Sense (The ANS)Item CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructNUM_01"Do you have difficulty counting objects accurately (e.g., do you lose track easily)?"One-to-One Correspondence: Basic counting adherence.NUM_02"Do you have to count items one-by-one (e.g., dots on a dice) rather than just 'seeing' how many there are?"Subitizing: The defining core deficit. Neurotypicals subitize up to 4-5 items instantly.NUM_03"Do you find it much harder to count backwards (e.g., 20 down to 1) than forwards?"Reverse Sequence Working Memory: Indicates weak number line mentalization.NUM_04"Do you find it difficult to estimate costs (e.g., knowing roughly how much a shopping cart will cost)?"Estimation: Reliance on the ANS.Domain B: Arithmetic & OperationsItem CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructNUM_05"Do you have difficulty remembering basic math facts (e.g., 7 + 5, multiplication tables)?"Long-Term Retrieval: Failure to automatize facts.NUM_06"Do you rely on your fingers to do simple calculations?"Concrete Dependency: Inability to abstract quantity.NUM_07"Do you confuse mathematical symbols (e.g., + and x)?"Symbol Recognition: Visual-orthographic issue with math.NUM_08"When adding (e.g., 7 + 3), do you count 1, 2, 3... rather than starting at 7 and counting on?"Counting-On Strategy: Indicates primitive arithmetic strategy.Domain C: Functional Numeracy & AnxietyItem CodeUser-Facing Symptom QuestionClinical ConstructNUM_09"Do you struggle to tell the time on an analog clock?"Temporal-Spatial: Circular number line mapping.NUM_10"Do you get anxious immediately when asked to do a math problem?"Maths Anxiety: Emotional blockade of working memory.NUM_11"Do you misread numbers (e.g., reading 51 as 15)?"Directionality/Place Value: Dyslexic-type error in math.NUM_12"Do you find mental math (e.g., calculating change) difficult or impossible?"Working Memory Load: Inability to hold variables.NUM_13"Do you forget PIN numbers or phone numbers frequently?"Numerical Memory.NUM_14"Do you drive too fast or slow because you misjudge speed/distance?"Spatial-Temporal Estimation.NUM_15"Do you find financial planning or budgeting impossible to understand?"Functional Impairment.6.3 Precision Scoring and InterpretationCore Deficit Flag: An "Always" (5) or "Often" (4) response to NUM_02 (Subitizing) is the single strongest predictor of dyscalculia. This ability is foundational; its absence suggests a structural difference in the parietal lobe.Anxiety Distinction:Scenario A: High scores on Domain A/B + High Score on NUM_10 (Anxiety) -> Dyscalculia with secondary anxiety.Scenario B: Low scores on Domain A/B (can subitize/count) + High Score on NUM_10 + High Score on NUM_12 (Mental Math) -> Maths Anxiety / Working Memory Issue. The report should highlight that the user has number sense but is blocked by anxiety.Overall Probability: A consistent pattern of 4s and 5s across domains indicates Probable Dyscalculia.7. Integrated Analysis: The "Spiky Profile" Algorithm7.1 Cross-Module Logic and Co-OccurrenceThe true power of this methodology lies in the integration of data points across modules to identify complex neurotypes. The algorithm must look for specific inter-module correlations.1. The "AuDHD" Flag (Autism + ADHD)Logic: ASRS Part A Score ≥ 4 AND CAT-Q Score > 100.Clinical Insight: This profile is characterized by a conflict between the need for routine (Autism) and the need for novelty (ADHD).Report Narrative: "Your profile suggests the presence of both ADHD and Autistic traits (AuDHD). This can create a unique internal conflict where you may crave stimulation but quickly become overwhelmed by it. You may find that your ADHD traits 'mask' your Autism (making you seem more social/impulsive) and vice versa."2. The Dyslexia/Dyspraxia OverlapLogic: Vinegrad Score > 9 AND ADC Total > 90.Clinical Insight: Suggests a generalized deficit in cerebellar sequencing and sensory integration.Report Narrative: "High scores in both Dyslexia and Dyspraxia modules suggest a broader difficulty with sequencing and organization. You likely find tasks that require 'multi-tasking' (like driving or cooking) exceptionally draining due to the double load on your motor and processing planning systems."3. The "Anxiety Masking" EffectLogic: CAT-Q > 120 AND ASRS Part A = 3 (Borderline).Clinical Insight: Extreme masking consumes executive function, potentially mimicking or suppressing ADHD symptoms.Report Narrative: "Your extremely high Camouflaging score suggests you exert immense effort to 'appear normal.' This cognitive load can deplete your executive function, looking like ADHD, OR your strict self-control might be suppressing outward signs of ADHD. The 'sub-clinical' ADHD score should be re-evaluated in the context of this high masking effort."7.2 The Visual Output: Neurodivergent HeatmapThe final user report must visualize these results as a Radar Chart (Spider Plot) rather than a list of numbers.Axis 1: Executive Function (ADHD) (Normalized ASRS Score).Axis 2: Social Masking (Autism) (Normalized CAT-Q Score).Axis 3: Phonological Processing (Normalized Vinegrad Score).Axis 4: Motor Coordination (Normalized ADC Score).Axis 5: Numeracy (Normalized Chinn Score).Severity Color Coding:Green (0-30%): Likely Neurotypical range.Yellow (31-70%): Sub-clinical / Traits present (Neurospicy).Red (71-100%): High Probability / Clinical Range.8. ConclusionThis methodology provides a comprehensive, empirically grounded framework for assessing adult neurodiversity. By integrating the ASRS v1.1, CAT-Q, Vinegrad, ADC, and Chinn checklists into a unified system, it addresses the specific needs of the undiagnosed adult population. The shift to symptom-based questioning mitigates the risk of false negatives caused by lifelong masking, while the "Spiky Profile" scoring model validates the complex, multi-faceted nature of neurodivergence. This tool serves not as a diagnostic endpoint, but as a high-fidelity roadmap for self-discovery and clinical advocacy.References Used in Methodology Design:
